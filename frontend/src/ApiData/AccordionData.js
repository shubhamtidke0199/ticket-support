        query:'1. iPhone White Screen of Death',
        answer:'Failed upgrade, jailbreak or hardware problem can lead to iPhone White Screen of Death. You can restart the device. If that fails to resolve the issue, hard reset (factory reset) your iPhone. If hard reset too does not work, boot your iPhone in DFU (Device Firmware Upgrade) mode. But remember, both hard rest and booting in DFU mode will clear all your settings and data on iPhone. If you confront a situation where your iPhone is stuck at white screen and you do not have iCloud or iTunes backup, then, first recover your complete data through Stellar Recovery for iPhone. Next fix iPhone white screen with hard reset or DFU mode.'

        answer:'Spilled a glass of water on your iPhone or accidently dropped it in the swimming pool! Water damaged iPhones may or may not turn on. There are high chances of losing your iPhone data too. Even Apple does not cover liquid damages in its one-year warranty. Dry it by rubbing on a towel and remove the SIM card. Do not plug it or turn it on. You can also keep it with silica gel sachets for about two days to dry.Unfortunately water or any other liquid in your iPhone results in loss of iPhone data. Do not panic. You can recover your lost photos, videos, audios, contacts etc., from iCloud or iTunes backup. If unable to restore from backup, use Stellar Data recovery for iPhone'

        query:'3. Startup issues',
        answer:'If your Mac fails to boot properly and you find yourself staring at a blank screen or gray startup screen instead of your desktop, then its time to try booting in Safe Mode. In Safe Mode, MacOS will boot with the bare minimum of software and drivers required and will run a check of your startup disk and repair any directory issues that might be the cause of your startup ills. To start up in safe mode, start your Mac and then press and hold the Shift key. The Apple logo will appear and then the login screen. You can release the Shift key when the Apple logo disappears and the login screen appears. It may take a few minutes before you get to the login screen as MacOS runs its diagnostics on your hard disk. To leave Safe Mode and start up your Mac per usual, just restart your Mac without holding any keys.'

        query:'4. Unresponsive app',
        answer:'You might find that an app will occasionally trip up your Mac and hang. And when an app hangs, it freezes you out and wont let you do anything, including quit out of it. Enter: Force Quit. You can call up the Force Quit menu from the Apple icon in the upper-left corner or by hitting Command-Option-Escape. Just highlight the app thats not responding and hit the Force Quit button. (You can also select multiple apps to force quit by using holding down the Command or Shift keys when making your selections.)'

        query:'5. Proximity Sensor Not Working',
        answer:"If your iPhone's display screen is lit during call, it means the proximity sensor is not working. This might also cause problems with touch screen. A faulty proximity center in iPhone can be the manufacturing defect or a software issue. The problem may also occur after you have replaced your iPhone screen. To troubleshoot restart your iPhone, reboot or perform factory reset. You can also restore iPhone with iTunes in DFU mode to fix proximity sensor problem. But do take backup at iCloud and iTunes before performing these tasks."
